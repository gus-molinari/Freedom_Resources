# Freedom_Resources
These are compiled resources for people that want to live a free life without the involvement of the state coming from the perspective of a Austro-Libertarian macro-economic world view, specifically with a Rothbardian approach (Anarcho-Capitalism). This compiled list of resources aim to address ways for individuals to live private sovereign lives, outside the arms of the state.

__How To Leave the Financial System__

IBC- What is IBC? the Infinite Banking Concept is a wealth-flow management system that doesn't use the traditional banking system. The traditional banking system is a major contributor to the creation of cash from thin air. It contributes to the problem of fractional-reserve banking. IBC helps to create a warehouse for you to store your cash outside of the banking system that is arbitrarily manipulated by the central banks. Individuals can use it as an alternative the normal retirement schemes that are seen as the only way forward in a central banking controlled world (401k's, IRA's, etc.). If you don't participate in the normal banking infrastructure, you can't contribute to the growing problem, which in turn gives the central bank much less power over you.

Bob Murphy and Carlos Lara do a great podcast about ways to secede from the current banking regime.

Why does non-kyc assets matter?
Bitcoin is the hardest currency on the planet. A Government cannot inflate the value of Bitcoin away. They cannot deduct taxes directly from your bitcoin wallet or mandate they control all of the supply (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102). They cannot wage arbitrary wars if they do not control the money supply. If there is a potential way for the government's to try and control Bitcoin, either through seizure or denial-of-service, it will be through surveillance. Non-KYC bitcoin is the only way to obtain self-sovereignty. Below are some resources that give potential options for you to obtain non-kyc bitcoin. Use this to your advantage. Size up your threat model and become self-sovereign.
