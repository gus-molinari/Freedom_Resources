# Freedom_Resources
These are compiled resources for people that want to live a free life without the involvement of the state coming from the perspective of a Austro-Libertarian macro-economic world view, specifically with a Rothbardian approach (Anarcho-Capitalism). This compiled list of resources aim to address ways for individuals to live private sovereign lives, outside the arms of the state.

__Why Do This__
The only way around a system built to keep people subjugated is to go around this system. Don't ask permission.

## Online Browsing Techniques
- Use open source software
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg
There are many different places to start. https://www.reddit.com/r/FindMeADistro/


- Use open source password managers
  - use strong uniquely generated passwords for each account
  - use uniquely generated usernames for each account (where applicable)
  - use uniquley generated emails for each account (for example: https://simplelogin.io/, https://anonaddy.com/, https://33mail.com/ )

__TOR__
https://www.torproject.org/
TOR obfuscates your browsing traffic. The browser's goal is to pbfuscate your browsing and make your unique browser fingerprint look like every other TOR user.

## Secure Workstation Techniques
Secure your workstation with Full Disk Encryption. If using a debian-based distribution, LUKS is the specific software I am suggesting. Full Disk Encryption encrypts the entire system partition. This prevents attackers who want access to the data on your storage device from accessing it without permission.

Using Veracrypt you can create encrypted files and volumes for your personal device (https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html)
This prevents access to the data without proper permissions.

## Secure Communication Channels
Secure Communication should focus on zero-knowledge end-to-end encryption. If your communications are stored on a server, you want to make sure only you and your intended recipent can decrypt it.

__How To Leave the Current Financial System__

IBC- What is IBC? the Infinite Banking Concept is a wealth-flow management system that doesn't use the traditional banking system. The traditional banking system is a major contributor to the creation of cash from thin air. It contributes to the problem of fractional-reserve banking. IBC helps to create a warehouse for you to store your cash outside of the banking system that is arbitrarily manipulated by the central banks. Individuals can use it as an alternative the normal retirement schemes that are seen as the only way forward in a central banking controlled world (401k's, IRA's, etc.). If you don't participate in the normal banking infrastructure, you can't contribute to the growing problem, which in turn gives the central bank much less power over you.

Bob Murphy and Carlos Lara do a great podcast about ways to secede from the current banking regime.

VPN's
There are many sites out there that offer recommendations for Virtual Private Network services. That one Privacy Guy does a good job at trying to remain neautral in his reviews. Consider VPN's that contribute to privacy preserving causes. 
Consider anonymous payment for your VPN service as you now take the privacy concern from your ISP and shift it to the VPN provider. Even if the VPN provider is malicious, an anonymous payment will further segregate your identity from your VPN account.

Why does obtaining crypto via non-kyc matter?
Bitcoin is the hardest currency on the planet. A Government cannot inflate the value of Bitcoin away. They cannot deduct taxes directly from your bitcoin wallet or mandate they control all of the supply (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102). They cannot wage arbitrary wars if they do not control the money supply. If there is a potential way for the government's to try and control Bitcoin, either through seizure or denial-of-service, it will be through surveillance. Non-KYC bitcoin is the only way to obtain self-sovereignty. Below are some resources that give potential options for you to obtain non-kyc bitcoin. Use this to your advantage. Size up your threat model and become self-sovereign.

## Obtaining Bitcoin Anonymously.


Register for https://localmonero.co
I would suggest using the onion site via TOR: http://localmonerogt7be.onion
After you create an account, you can buy monero via mail. After you obtain XMR, you can then convert it via a shifting service like:
https://changenow.io/
https://www.morphtoken.com/


You can also buy btc through Agora Desk http://agoradeska6jfxpf.onion

After you obtain a small amount of bitcoin, you can then buy more BTC on BISQ https://bisq.network/


Here is an aggregated list of more p2p exchanges (some require KYC)

__Mixers__

Why use mixers?
You use a mixer to obfuscate the path from where you personally obtained your bitcoin. There is plausible deniability created by mixing your Bitcoin UTXOs.

Bitcoin Mixers
Wasabi https://www.wasabiwallet.io/
Samourai Wallet https://samouraiwallet.com/
JoinMarket https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver You can make more Bitcoin by offering your Bitcoin up for liquidity in this mixing pool.
