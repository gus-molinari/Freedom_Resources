# Freedom Resources
These are compiled resources for people that want to live a free life without the involvement of the state coming from the perspective of a Austro-Libertarian macro-economic world view, specifically with a Rothbardian approach (Anarcho-Capitalism). This compiled list of resources aim to address ways for individuals to live private sovereign lives, outside the arms of the state.


This compiled list is a guide for the person who wants to avoid participating in the current system. These are potential solutions. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. These are strategies that are available to people today. This is focused on North America but many of these strategies are applicable everywhere.

Don't stand around and talk about it. Act. You don't need to worry about converting someone to your side, just go out and do it. If it's functional, people will realize it. It doesn't need to be overnight. Better yourself and others will see that.

__Why?__
The only way through a system built to keep people subjugated is to go around this system. Don't ask permission.

*Where to begin*

## Online Browsing Techniques
- Use open source software
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg
There are many different places to start. https://www.reddit.com/r/FindMeADistro/


- Use open source password managers
  - use strong uniquely generated passwords for each account
  - use uniquely generated usernames for each account (where applicable)
  - use uniquley generated emails for each account (for example: https://simplelogin.io/, https://anonaddy.com/, https://33mail.com/ )

__TOR__
https://www.torproject.org/
TOR obfuscates your browsing traffic. The browser's goal is to pbfuscate your browsing and make your unique browser fingerprint look like every other TOR user.

__Public Data Scrubbing__
Data brokers and data marketers work to sell your information to profit from your data. History proves that they are activiely working with the state to undermine our autonomy. Below is a pdf workbook that aims to help label and give solutions to opt-out of their data collection. The author, Bazzell starts with insisting on a credit freeze at the major credit bureaus (We know they aren't to be the trusted arbiters of our data)
- https://inteltechniques.com/data/workbook.pdf
This process is tedious but first you should aim for the largest data brokers. Thus will help prevent your data from re-populating on the newest data broker that enters on the scene as most of this information is taken from the big players in the space.

## Secure Workstation Techniques
Secure your workstation with Full Disk Encryption. If using a debian-based distribution, LUKS is the specific software I am suggesting. Full Disk Encryption encrypts the entire system partition. This prevents attackers who want access to the data on your storage device from accessing it without permission.

Using Veracrypt you can create encrypted files and volumes for your personal device (https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html)
This prevents access to the data without proper permissions.

## Secure Communication Channels
Secure Communication should focus on zero-knowledge end-to-end encryption. If your communications are stored on a server, you want to make sure only you and your intended recipent can decrypt it. 
__Email__

Protonmail
Tutanota

__Messaging Applications__
Signal - requires a phone number. The danger behind giving a phone number is that you end up giving away a personal identifier. Your phone number can be used to discover personal details about you from many people search sites such as reversephonelookup.com
A VoIP number works with signal. 

Wire - You can create an account with a phone number or an email (burner email preferably)

Wickr - no phone number or email needed.



__Why VoIP?__
Phone porting is a relativley new concern that plagues our digital lives. With the desire for services to avoid spam issues, they require phone numbers to verify that you are a human. It is trivial for someone to port a phone number from a specific phone provider. Social engineering is a huge concern, and it takes a short amount of time to port a phone number. The ways to avoid phone porting issues are:
VoIP (Phone numbers can't be ported if there is no phone provider to port them from)
Anonymous Phone numbers not attached to your identity

VoIP services to consider:
Google Voice
MySudo (9 phone numbers for 15$/month) You can use a different phone number for different use cases: spam, travel, SMS 2FA for online services, banking, friends, etc.

Anonymous Phone purchases
- Buy a flip phone from a big box store with burner sms with cash

or

- Buy an unlocked phone in person with cash
- Buy a sim card in person with cash
- Pay for a T-Mobile pay as you go plan in person with cash

You now have a phone number that you can re-up with in-store payments. The type of phone you get will also play a role in how you maintain an anonymous phone. You should never use your regular phone number to give to ANYONE. friends. family, businesses, and work will leak this informtion and once its leaked, you're whole anonymous phone strategy is ruined.

The operating system you use on your mobile device plays a crucial role in you maintaining your digital anonymity.

__Mobile Operating Systems__
Google's monetization model is based on collecting and selling your data. Graphene and Lineage are de-googled android operating systems focused on privacy.
- Graphene OS
- Lineage OS

If you get an Iphone, it is becoming extremely difficult to register an icloud account without a real (non-VoIP) phone number. It's not impossible, but much more difficult. Consider this before you make your purchase.


## How To Leave the Current Financial System

IBC- What is IBC? the Infinite Banking Concept is a wealth-flow management system that doesn't use the traditional banking system. The traditional banking system is a major contributor to the creation of cash from thin air. It contributes to the problem of fractional-reserve banking. IBC helps to create a warehouse for you to store your cash outside of the banking system that is arbitrarily manipulated by the central banks. Individuals can use it as an alternative the normal retirement schemes that are seen as the only way forward in a central banking controlled world (401k's, IRA's, etc.). If you don't participate in the normal banking infrastructure, you can't contribute to the growing problem, which in turn gives the central bank much less power over you.


IBC is based on whole-term life insurance policies. This is also a great privacy preserving technique. When you want to use the money inside your policy in regards to a policy loan, there is no credit pull on you. There are no questions asked as to what you are using the money for. The money arrives in a check to you by the next business day. 

Bob Murphy and Carlos Lara do a great podcast about ways to secede from the current banking regime.

VPN's
There are many sites out there that offer recommendations for Virtual Private Network services. That one Privacy Guy does a good job at trying to remain neautral in his reviews. Consider VPN's that contribute to privacy preserving causes. 
Consider anonymous payment for your VPN service as you now take the privacy concern from your ISP and shift it to the VPN provider. Even if the VPN provider is malicious, an anonymous payment will further segregate your identity from your VPN account.

Why does obtaining crypto via non-kyc matter?
Bitcoin is the hardest currency on the planet. A Government cannot inflate the value of Bitcoin away. They cannot deduct taxes directly from your bitcoin wallet or mandate they control all of the supply (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102). They cannot wage arbitrary wars if they do not control the money supply. If there is a potential way for the government's to try and control Bitcoin, either through seizure or denial-of-service, it will be through surveillance. Non-KYC bitcoin is the only way to obtain self-sovereignty. Below are some resources that give potential options for you to obtain non-kyc bitcoin. Use this to your advantage. Size up your threat model and become self-sovereign.

## Obtaining Bitcoin Anonymously


Register for https://localmonero.co
Hidden service is heavily suggested: http://localmonerogt7be.onion
After you create a burner account, you can buy monero via mail. After you obtain XMR, you can then convert it via a shifting service like:
https://simpleswap.io
http://xchangen24yn24b6.onion/
https://changenow.io/
https://www.morphtoken.com/



You can also buy btc through Agora Desk http://agoradeska6jfxpf.onion

After you obtain a small amount of bitcoin, you can then buy more BTC on BISQ https://bisq.network/


Here is an aggregated list of more p2p exchanges (some require KYC)

__Coinjoins__

Why use mixers?
You use a mixer to obfuscate the path from where you personally obtained your bitcoin. There is plausible deniability created by mixing your Bitcoin UTXOs.

## Free Market Health Care Solutions
Despite the regulation that exists, there are still ways to receive medical coverage without participating in the system perpetuating the growth of the state. 

Direct Primary Care providers offers a way for you to pay a subscription to your doctor directly. This greatly cuts the cost for basic medical care.

Health Sharing Ministries in conjunction with a direct primary care provider offers a potential solution for health care.
Health Sharing Ministries are relgious based organizations, so there may be coverage that they choose not to support as it goes against their beliefs. Do your own research.
